    Reading is important because it develops our thoughts, gives us endless knowledge and lessons while keeping our minds active. Books can hold and keep all kinds of information, stories, thoughts and feelings unlike anything else in this world.Reading enhances our language skills and develops fluency, allowing us to express our thoughts and ideas better. Books quench our thirst for knowledge. Through books, we learn anything. They take them into world of imagination and joy.
